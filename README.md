### NPM package update commands
You need to create an npm account, and I can give you "publish" permissions for the WebElements. Otherwise, just let me know when you've pushed changes, I'll review and publish them on npm

```bash
# Update the repository
$ git commit -a -m "Your update message"
$ git push origin master

# Update the npm package (requires an npm account)
$ npm version patch
$ npm publish
```
